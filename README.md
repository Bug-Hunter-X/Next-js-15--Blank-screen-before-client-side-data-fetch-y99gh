# Next.js 15 Client-Side Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using client-side data fetching in Next.js 15 applications. The problem is that the page initially renders as a blank screen before the data is fetched and displayed.

## Problem

The `about.js` file fetches data from a simulated API call with a 3-second delay.  During this delay, the user sees a blank screen. This is undesirable in a production app.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates several solutions to address this problem:

1. **Loading State:**  The solution includes a visual loading state. This displays an indicator (e.g., "Loading..." message) while the data is being fetched, improving the user experience.

2. **Suspense:**  (Optional, but for larger apps it's highly recommended) It uses React Suspense for asynchronous rendering which can improve the performance if many different parts of the page require asynchronous data.
